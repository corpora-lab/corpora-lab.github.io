Michele Chiari is the PI of the CORPORA project, which will fund his PostDoc at TU Wien until August 2025.

His research interests cover formal methods for the verification of safety-critical and real-time systems, focusing on temporal logic, formal languages and automata theory.

He is currently working on context-free temporal logic and model checking.
During his PhD at Politecnico di Milano, he developed POTL, a new temporal logic based on Operator Precedence Languages, with the purpose of allowing better and more general modeling and specification of procedural programs.
Within the CORPORA project, he will extend these previous results to probabilistic model checking.
