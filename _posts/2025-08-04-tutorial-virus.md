# A virus outbreak

The COVID-19 pandemic started in 2020 has demonstrated that dangers posed by the worldwide spread of new viruses.
The spread of viruses and other infectious diseases can be studied through epidemiological models.
These models try to give a mathematical representation of the mechanisms by which the disease spreads into the population, with the purpose of getting insights into how such processes work.
