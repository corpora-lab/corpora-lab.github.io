#  OPPAS 3.0 released

We just released OPPAS, the *Operator-Precedence Program Analysis Suite*.

OPPAS includes version 3.0 of POMC, our tool for the analysis of recursive programs,
and the first version of POPACheck, our tool for the analysis of probabilistic programs with nested queries.

To get started with OPPAS, visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/corpora-lab/OPPAS){:target="_blank"}.

You can access the documentation [here](https://github.com/corpora-lab/OPPAS/blob/master/docs/guide.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

We will soon publish a series of blog posts to introduce users to expressing complex stochastic problems with probabilistic programs,
and to get them started to analyzing them with OPPAS.
